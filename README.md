# Vehical-Detection
Vehicle Detection uses YOLOv5 to identify and classify vehicles like cars, trucks, and bikes in images. Built on Google Colab, it supports real-time detection with APIs for data handling. Ideal for traffic monitoring, safety systems, and parking management, it provides accurate results with bounding boxes and classifications.
